# Graph-Based Data Collections Explorer

This repository is the home for the "next generation" Data Collections Explorer.
It makes use of a graph based data model.

## Graph

The basic structure of the graph is outlined [here](graph/README.md). You can
serve your own instance or query the graph, as described [here](docker/README.md).

## Development

While the [previous version](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/Data-Collections-Explorer)
is still actively maintained, all further development will take place here.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Exceptions are
explicitly stated; currently, this only affects files in the [docker](docker/README.md)
directory.

## Acknowledgements
